### IIS Web Server
- (Internet Information Server)

|tutorial|

- Since the introduction of Windows 7, every operating system has a local WebServ (local web server).

- After each installation of an operating system, this is deactivated by default.
- However, it is just waiting to be activated.

### Step 1:
To do this, please First Click on the Windows Logo in your Taskbar and Enter in the search field:
|Optional Features|
|---|
---

### Step 2:
A window will now open, please look for the tab there
| Internet Information Services |
|---|
---

### Found? Very good!

### Now you provide this with a tick.
Before you click OK, quickly search for the tab...
| Application Development Features |
|---|
---

### You can find this among those just activated,
| Internet Information Services (+) | WWW services (+)| General HTTP Features (+)| Application development features (+)|
|---|---|---|---|
- Just quickly activate CGI there, and now you can activate the services by clicking OK.
---

The process should be completed within a few seconds.
---

### Step 3:
- The local web server for Windows 10 or Windows 11 is now activated.
- Now we install the MySql database and PHP on the computer.
---

- For this we download the Windows Platform Installer from Microsoft.
- You can get it here [DOWNLOAD](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=287166)
---

### If the Platform Installer has been downloaded, please install it.

- Launch platformer from the programs!

|"(Microsoft Web Platform Installer)"|
|---|

- The platformer only searches for installed components for a few seconds.

- Then we devote ourselves to the products and enter -> MySql in the search field.
- For the latest version, we click –> Add "Mysql Windows ......."

### Next we need PHP.
So we enter PHP in the search field. We need the following file for our web server: "PHP 7.2 For IIS Express

|It is recommended to use the largest possible new version.|
|---|
Now that MySql and PHP have been added, there is a third entry in the overview again.
That is absolutely correct!

|Now we can all Install...|
|---|

- Then the program asks what password you want to use for the MySql database.
- Please write down the username –> root and the password, which you have to enter twice.

### Hello IIS
- This is now ready for operation, but there are still a few little things missing!
---
- For this purpose I have already created a .php that allows to generate secure passwords up to 95 characters long.
- (You decide how long the password should be).
- No two passwords are the same!

### Thanks to the activated web server, your hard drive now contains: C:/ an "inetpub directory"

There are more subfolders, now load the archive from my developer forge
[DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/bylickilabs/InternetInformationServer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

### After the download, please open the downloaded archive!

Please move the files from the .php folder to...
| C:/inetpub/wwwroot |
|---|

There is already an update in the archive, please move the .php now
according to our
| wwwroot |
|---|

### The update already contains some innovations!

Now you can open the browser and there you enter the following:
| localhost/phpinfo.php |
|---|

- or use the following button to open the .php
[Open](http://localhost/phpinfo.php)

The .php was encrypted in advance and cannot be encrypted afterwards
be changed by third parties.
As a developer, I have reserved this option for myself.

Ps. Check out this page from time to time. Just in case new updates are released.
- If you have already done so, you can find the new download HERE.
